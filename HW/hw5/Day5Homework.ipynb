    "# Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to find a way to distinguish email addresses from other strings. For example, 'jeb@jeb.org' is a valid email address, while 'jeb' is not. Your task is to write a function that receives a string and returns True if the string is a valid email address or False if the string is not a valid address.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules defining valid email addresses are extremely complicated, but they generally consist of a local part and a domain part connected by an '@' symbol. In Hillary Clinton's email address (hdr22@clintonemail.com), `hdr22` is the local part while `clintonemail.com` is the domain. Both the local and domain parts must begin and end with alphanumeric characters, but they may contain both '.' and '-' characters within them. The `.com` part is known as the top-level domain, and this must be present in some form, such as `.com`, `.edu`, `.co.uk`, `.gov`, etc.. See the examples below for further clarification:\n",
